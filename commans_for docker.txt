Steps:
1. Create a project on github and pull to our local machine
2. Create the following files and a folder, then populate them with the text first
        > Dockerfile
        > requirements.txt
        > .dockerignore
        > app

3. Install docker and docker-compose in our local machine if not already installed. (this is one time action)
        $ sudo apt install docker.io
        $ sudo apt install docker-compose

4. Execute the build command
        $ sudo docker build .  // here . is for current directory

5. Create docker-compose.yml and populate with and then build a docker-compose image
        $ sudo docker-compose build

6. Extention download on VSCode
        > docker  (for automated docker command)
        > Flake8  (for linting)
        > Pylance


7. Now some work with flake8.
        > create requirements.dev.txt file and populate with code I made.
        > update docker-compose.yml file by adding new lines in no (7,12, 16-18)
        > and finally build the docker image again
                $ sudo docker-compose build

        > create requirements.dev.txt file and populate with code
        > then run the flake8 running command again
                $ sudo docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "flake8"  // this command is not working on my machine

8. Create a django project in the docker container
        $ sudo docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "django-admin startproject app ."  // here . is to avoid creating the sub-directory

9. Run django project within the docker container
        $ sudo docker-composer up

10. Create github actions - steps ->
        > create checks.yml within (root direction) .github/workflows/checks.yml
        > then populate the checks.yml file

11. Adding Database services to Docker 
        > update docker-compose.yml file with line 15 to 33 and then
        $ sudo docker-compose up  // to stest if everything added correctly 
        finally Ctrl+C and 
                $ sudo docker-compose down  // to completely stop the container services

12. Connect Database with django using docker
        > add the following in order and sequence as in Dockerfile
                apk add --update --no-cache postgresql-client && \
                apk add --update --no-cache --virtual .tmp-build-deps \
                build-base postgresql-dev musl-dev && \

                apk del .tmp-build-deps && \

        > update the requirements.txt file with
                psycopg2>=2.8.6,<2.9   // it is a adapter to connect database with django
